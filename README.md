# CK2MusicFileGenerator
Generates a music file for Crusader Kings 2 

This is a windows application that automatically generates a file to manage music in Crusader Kings 2 

Usage: 
Download the executable from bin/debug

Put the executable in the same folder as the .ogg files you're going to use for the game (I personally recommend doing this in a seperate folder from your mod folder)

Run the .exe

Click "Get Files". If you've done everything right so far, a list of .ogg songs found in the folder should show up. 

Click "Generate". This should generate the songs.txt file for your mod.
